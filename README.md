# data-activism

The project looked to analyze a dataset and create visualizations to represent the analysis completed for LIS4210 Data Visualization.

The dataset used was the Child Opportunity Index 2.0 to answer questions regarding children’s healthy development. The dataset used weighted z-scores to determine the quality of neighborhood resources and conditions in which children aged 0-17 grow up. It also included qualitative assessments, information on the metro areas and states (within the national landscape), and z-scores normalized to national, state, and metro levels. The original dataset in the repository is made up of multiple .csv files, including an index, child population data (e.g., race/ethnicity), raw indicator values, and raw z-scores.

The dataset used was the Index file from https://data.diversitydatakids.org/dataset/coi20-child-opportunity-index-2-0-database. The data can also be found on Github https://github.com/diversitydatakids/COI.
